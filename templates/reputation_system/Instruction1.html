    <p>
    The experiment has multiple rounds. In the experiment, participants will be equally divided into two roles: Player A and Player B.
    Your role does not change during the experiment.
    Participants are divided into groups of 4 people with 2 player A and 2 player B.
    You will be grouped with the same participants during the experiment.
    </p>

    <p>
    Each round has multiple stages as follows:
        <br>
    Stage 1: All player B choose between O and E. If player B chooses O, her payoff is determined and her round ends.
    If player B chooses E, she will move to Stage 2.
        <br>
    Stage 2: If the experiment allows, player B who choose E at Stage 1 can choose the price of her E.
    Otherwise price will be given by the system and Stage 2 will be skipped.
        <br>
    Stage 3: Observing player Bs' past choices and the price of E in the current round,
    Player A chooses which player B to interact with by choosing the corresponding ID of player B.
    Player A can only interact with player B who chooses E at Stage 1.
    Player A can also choose to interact with no one to guarantee some payoff by choosing 0.
        <br>
    Stage 4: If player B has been interacted with one or more player A, she chooses either X or Y, which determined the payoff of the players she is interacting with.
        <br>
    </p>

    <p>
    The results will be calculated after stage 4.
    All participants receive the payoff in the current round and the experiment moves to the next round.
